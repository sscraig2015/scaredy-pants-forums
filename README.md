## "This sounds great! How do I start immediately?"

Head on over to the OFFICIAL  [Scaredy Pants Forums](https://scaredy-pants-forum.herokuapp.com/signin) and create an account, it's that easy! 

## "Aww geez, I think I'm in over my head. Where do I start?"

Do not worry, as of now this is only a text based forum and you need not worry about images, videos, or any external links. Let's go ahead and make a new topic.

* To add a topic click on the "Create New Topic" button on the right side of the screen. 
* Add a "Topic Title" and include some "Text" to get the conversation going. Ask people what their favorite horror movie is or maybe start a discussion about who the best scream queen is! It's all up to you!



## "How could one man accomplish all this?"
Thank you, but it's actually not as hard as it looks!

My application is built with the following technologies:
* Ruby on Rails
* React
